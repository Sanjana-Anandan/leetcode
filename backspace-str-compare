PROBLEM : https://leetcode.com/problems/backspace-string-compare/
DIFFICULTY: EASY
QUESTION: Given two strings s and t, return true if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. '#' means a backspace character.

CODE:
class Solution:
    def back(self , s: str) -> str:
        result = ""
        for i in range(0,len(s)):
            if s[i]=="#":
                result = result[0:len(result)-1]
            else:
                result+=s[i]
        return result

    def backspaceCompare(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        return self.back(s)==self.back(t)
APPROACH: If character is not # then add to result string. If it is # then slice result string to exclude last added character
TIME COMPLEXITY: O(n)
TEST CASES: PASSED
